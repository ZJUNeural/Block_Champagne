implemention of Block-Champagne in realistic data 

The SPM data contains multi-modality data from subjects undergoing face-processing task. The detailed information can be found in "A multi-subject, multi-modal human neuroimaging dataset". Here we provide the fMRI and ERP data from subject #15, following the guideline in SPM12 manual

The DBS data contains high-density EEG data collected concurrently with deep brain stimulation. The detailed information can be found in "Simultaneous human intracerebral stimulation and HD-EEG: ground-truth for source localization methods". Here we provide the data from subject #1 and subject #7, following the processing pipeline provided in https://gin.g-node.org/ezemikulan/Localize-MI.
